1. I spent about two hours working on this project, not counting watching the
intro videos.

2. I enjoyed learning about the difference between class methods and instance
methods, and how to use each of them together.

3. I added a "wallet" for each customer (with the amount of cash they have) and
the program throws an error if a customer tries to buy something they can't. I
also added the ability to return a product that a customer has already
purchased.

4. I was a little shaky on my use of the options method, and I'm not sure if my
initializers are done the Ruby way, so I'd appreciate any tips you have in
either of those areas, or anything else I could improve upon!
